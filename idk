    <h1>The Peace of Wild Things, by Wendell Berry</h1>
    <p>When despair for the world grows in me<br>
and I wake in the night at the least sound
in fear of what my life and my childrenâ€™s lives may be,
I go and lie down where the wood drake
rests in his beauty on the water, and the great<br> heron feeds.
I come into the peace of wild things
who do not tax their lives with forethought
of grief. I come into the presence of still water.
And I feel above me the day-blind stars
waiting with their light. For a time
I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.</p>
